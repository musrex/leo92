>The moonlight glows through  
>Early spring branches while wet  
>Grass kisses our feet.  
>  
>The moon could have shone  
>Brighter than ever before  
>But who'd have noticed?  

This is a poem I found in my Google Drive. I'm not sure how I got to 
the title, April 27th, 2021. According to the Google Drive history, 
the document was started on April 30th, 2021. I'm sure it came from 
something I wrote and dated in my Field Notes. According to the history,
I edited it a bit the next month, on May 13, and didn't touch it again 
until January this year. I stumbled on it again on May 29, where I put 
what I'd say are the finishing touches.

The poem borrows from the haiku form. It's essentially to haikus back 
to back. I wanted both moments to exist on their own, but I also wanted
to share that the night, overall, was wonderful.
